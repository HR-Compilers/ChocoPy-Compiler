# ChocoPy Compiler
This repository contains the source code for a compiler written in Chocopy, a programming language designed to make it easier for computer science students to learn the fundamentals of programming. The compiler was developed by Bas Laarakker (@BasLaa) and Matteo Becatti (@meloncruuush) during my exchange semester in Reykjavik, Iceland. 

Chocopy is a statically-typed, object-oriented programming language with a syntax inspired by Python. It is designed to be a simple yet powerful language that is easy to learn and understand. It has a robust type system with support for type inference, which allows the programmer to write code without explicitly specifying the types of variables or methods. It also has a built-in garbage collector, which helps manage memory usage and prevent memory leaks.

The compiler supports a range of features, including parsing and type checking of source code. It is written in Python and is designed to be easy to use and extend.
